## CSE116 Debugging Lab Activity

In this activity, you will be getting some practice debugging code by
fixing this broken code. There are tests provided for you that are correct
and will help you determine what is wrong and how you can fix it. With good use
of the debugger, you should be able to get al of the tests to pass.

The program here is a simple simulator for a restaurant tracking the revenue
it earns from selling items off of its menu. Comments in the main.Restaurant and
main.Item classes detail what the methods are supposed to do.

The class test.TestRestaurant holds all the provided tests, as well as comments
explaining what those tests are checking for to help you understand them.
